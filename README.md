# passive_wheel_attachment_crazy_flie_webots
This repository is for a project in Robotic Millisystems where I am designing a passive wheel attachment for the crazyflie and simulating its functionality in Webots.
I will also attempt printing out a passive wheel attachment for the crazy flie and hopefully will test the implementation on an actual crazyflie.

The base code is the crazy flie controller files made available in the crazy flie tutorial in Webots and the controller design for the robot rolling around is based
off this paper where a bicopter had a passive wheel attached at the bottom:
